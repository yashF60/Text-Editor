# React Rich Text Editor

A powerful and flexible rich text editor built with React. This editor supports basic text formatting, image uploads, link insertion, and a customizable toolbar. It's designed to be easily integrated into React applications, providing a clean and user-friendly experience for content editing.

## Features

* **Basic Text Formatting**: Bold, Italic, Underline, and Strikethrough.
* **Image Upload**: Easily upload and insert images into the editor.
* **Link Insertion**: Insert clickable links into your content.
* **Customizable Toolbar**: Control which formatting options are available.
* **Shared Editor Context**: Manage editor state and logic using React Context API.

## Installation

To install the rich text editor in your React project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @your-package-name/rich-text-editor
```

or

```bash
yarn add @your-package-name/rich-text-editor
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the Editor Component

```jsx
import { RichTextEditor } from '@your-package-name/rich-text-editor';
```

### 2. Wrap the Editor with the `EditorContext`

Make sure to wrap your editor component with the `EditorContext.Provider` to provide global state management for the editor.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { EditorContext, EditorProvider } from '@your-package-name/rich-text-editor';

function App() {
  return (
    <EditorProvider>
      <RichTextEditor />
    </EditorProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Customize the Toolbar (Optional)

You can customize the toolbar by passing the `toolbarOptions` prop.

```jsx
<RichTextEditor toolbarOptions={['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'image', 'link']} />
```

## Props

* **`toolbarOptions`** (array): Specifies which toolbar options to display. Options include `'bold'`, `'italic'`, `'underline'`, `'strikethrough'`, `'image'`, and `'link'`.
* **`placeholder`** (string): Placeholder text to show when the editor is empty.
* **`initialValue`** (string): Initial content to display inside the editor.
* **`onChange`** (function): A callback function that is triggered when the editor content changes.
