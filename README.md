# Text Editor

A modern and feature-rich text editor built with React. This editor includes rich text formatting, image uploads, and link insertion, all managed via a shared `EditorContext` for clean and maintainable state management.

## Features

* **Text Formatting**: Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, and more.
* **Image Upload**: Upload and insert images seamlessly into the editor.
* **Link Insertion**: Insert clickable links with ease.
* **Customizable Toolbar**: Modify the toolbar to show or hide specific formatting options.
* **State Management with React Context**: Use `EditorContext` to manage editor state globally.

## Installation

To integrate this text editor into your React project, you can clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashF60/Text-Editor.git
cd Text-Editor
npm install
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to install it as a package:

```bash
npm install @yashF60/text-editor
```

or

```bash
yarn add @yashF60/text-editor
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the Editor Component

```jsx
import { RichTextEditor } from '@yashF60/text-editor';
```

### 2. Wrap the Editor with the `EditorContext.Provider`

Ensure the editor component is wrapped in the `EditorContext.Provider` for state management.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { EditorContext, EditorProvider } from '@yashF60/text-editor';

function App() {
  return (
    <EditorProvider>
      <RichTextEditor />
    </EditorProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Customize the Toolbar (Optional)

Customize the toolbar by passing the `toolbarOptions` prop to include the formatting options you need.

```jsx
<RichTextEditor toolbarOptions={['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'image', 'link']} />
```

## Props

* **`toolbarOptions`** (array): Specifies which toolbar options should be available. Options include `'bold'`, `'italic'`, `'underline'`, `'strikethrough'`, `'image'`, and `'link'`.
* **`placeholder`** (string): Set a placeholder text to display when the editor is empty.
* **`initialValue`** (string): The initial content to populate the editor with.
* **`onChange`** (function): A callback function that is triggered whenever the content of the editor changes.
